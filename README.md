Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Studied category, region, and segment-wise performance.

Found that Technology and Office Supplies lead profits.

Identified that Furniture suffers low profit due to discounts.

Discovered strong Q4 seasonality in sales.

üí° Key Insights

Focus on Technology & Office Supplies ‚Äî they drive over 90% of profits.

Reassess Furniture pricing ‚Äî heavy discounts cause profit erosion.

Increase inventory for Copiers, Phones, Accessories ‚Äî high ROI products.

Regional strategy:

Expand marketing in South & Central to balance regional contribution.

Strengthen distribution in West & East for sustained dominance.

Demand Planning:

Stock up from September‚ÄìNovember to capture Q4 spikes.

Optimize inventory post-December to avoid overstock.

Discount Management:

Moderate discounts (<15%) maintain profitability; deeper cuts reduce margins drastically.

üìä Visuals 

Visual Insights

Forecast Graph: Shows clear upward trend with recurring yearly seasonality.

Confidence Intervals: Narrow ‚Üí high model certainty.

Profit Trend: Follows sales closely but with higher volatility due to discounts.
